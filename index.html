  <p><strong>Responsive design</strong> is what you use to automatically resize, hide, shrink or enlarge 
    a website to make it look good on all types of devices. Some of those include a phone,
tablet or computer. To simplify it, you could describe responsive design as the thing that makes sure that
the content you're adding to your webpage matches the viewport (screen) so that all the content fits.</p>
